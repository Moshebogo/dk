# BUSTER THE DRONE

This website gives the user the ability to control a personal drone for recreational use to security missions or even autonomous deliveries.

The easiest option is to use the drop down form to select drone commands and insert the IP address of the desired drone.

Alternatively the user can enter the IP address in the source code under app.py in the desired end-point.

The primary purpose of this website is the demonstrate how a front end can contol an external device and even pass on commands for flight.

Future updates include: 
Log-in verification for a user to save flight paths for recurrent use.
An interactive map allowing the user to click and draw a flight path accordingly.
